# Supplementary Files for:

## Ecologically Inspired Metrics for Transitioning to a Sustainable and Resilient Circular Economy with Application to Multilayer Plastic Films

### Description

This repository contains supplementary files for the journal manuscript titled *Ecologically Inspired Metrics for Transitioning to a Sustainable and Resilient Circular Economy with Application to Multilayer Plastic Films*. The supplementary files include an Excel file and a Jupyter Notebook that support the findings and methodologies discussed in the manuscript.

### Contents

1. **Results.xlsx**: This Excel file contains the results for the indicators for the multilayer plastic film example discussed in the paper. It also includes the calculations for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

2. **Source code.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the network analysis, tradeoff calculations, and more detailed calculations related to the study. The notebook uses various CSV files for input data, which are located in the `data` folder.

3. **data**: This folder contains all the CSV files used by the Jupyter Notebook for the calculations and analysis.

### Instructions

1. **Results.xlsx**: Open this file with any spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets) to view the results and GHG emissions calculations.

2. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda or pip.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `network_analysis_and_tradeoff_calculations.ipynb` file.
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the `network_analysis_and_tradeoff_calculations.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells to reproduce the network analysis, tradeoff calculations, and detailed calculations. The notebook reads the required data from the CSV files in the `data` folder.

### Dependencies

The Jupyter Notebook requires the following Python packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- math (standard library)
- matplotlib.pyplot
- scipy.special

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
